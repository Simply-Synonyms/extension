            <summary>How can I access synonyms?</summary>
            You can access synonyms by double clicking any word on most websites (clicking any word twice within a very short timespan). The word will usually turn blue as you select it and the Simply Synonyms popup will open. (It will not work on pages built into the extension, like this one).

            <summary>What can I do if it's not working?</summary>
            If it's not working, check the settings page to make sure it's enabled. If it still doesn't work please <a href="https://synonyms.bweb.app/contact">contact us</a>.

            <summary>Why can't the popup automatically replace a synonym for me?</summary>
            The popup can already automatically replace the word on most websites, including Google Docs. We do not yet support this feature on some websites (such as Gmail) which have a different type of input, but we will be adding this feature to all websites soon!

        <details>
            <summary>How do I change the settings?</summary>
            You can change the settings by right clicking the extension icon in your toolbar and choosing "options" or right clicking here and selecting "Simply Synonyms Tools > Help > Settings and Options". Or, you can just <a href="/page/settings.html">click here</a>.
