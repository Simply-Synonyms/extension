## Contributing

---

Your help is very welcome. Before implementing a feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Simply-Synonyms/simply-synonyms/issues/new) to discuss the changes or additions you want to make.

Make sure to check the [upcoming features](https://share.clickup.com/l/h/4-10555185-1/c7936bdf33d8baf) page to make sure the feature you want to implement isn't already in progress. Feel free to start coding one of the features in the to-do section!

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `main` and name it something like `feature-x-dev`.
- Implement/fix your feature, make sure to comment your code at least a little.
- Follow a semi-consistent code style for each file, including indentation.
- There isn't really a consistent commit naming system, but please make your commit names clear, for example "feat: keyboard shortcuts" or "fixed popup resizing bugs"
